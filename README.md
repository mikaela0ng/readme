## Overview of Observability

### Observability: Monitoring & Logging
Provides real-time insights into the health, performance, and status of workloads running within the Kubernetes environment. As the solution consists of structured logging, monitoring, and alerting, we enable efficient troubleshooting and rapid investigation of potential issues.

## Project Description

### Project Overview
The project aims to provide real-time insights into the health, performance, and status of workloads running within the Kubernetes environment. As the solution consists of structured logging, monitoring, and alerting, we enable efficient troubleshooting and rapid investigation of potential issues.
### Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide real-time insights into the health, performance, and status of workloads running within the Kubernetes environment. As the solution consists of structured logging, monitoring, and alerting, we enable efficient troubleshooting and rapid investigation of potential issues.

## Objectives:

### General Objectives
To use prometheus, alertmanager, grafana, and splunk to monitor logs of webapp and k8s cluster for efficient troubleshooting and problem/incident investigation.

Specifically, the group aims to do the following per tools:

- Webapps
   - Deployed in a Kubernetes cluster
   - Properties that enable to simulate the following issues:
      - High HTTP 5xx errors
      - High HTTP 4xx errors
      - Exporters stopped working
      - Splunkforwarder service or sidecar stopped working
           
- Jenkins
   - Set up a CI/CD pipeline that builds and deploys the app whenever code changes.
       
- Prometheus
   - Metric gathering solution of webapp.
       
- Alerting using Alertmanager/Prometheus or Splunk
    - Create alerting rules based on the KPIs:
        - % availability
        - Resource Utilization
        - Out of Memory Errors
        - Error Rates
   - Establish threshold and implement annotations

- Grafana
   - Use Prometheus as data source
   - Create a set of dashboard to monitor the following:
      - Cluster overview
         - count of pods running
         - count of pods failed
         - count of pods ready
         - ccount of pods not ready
         - node count
         - etc
      - Chart view of containers
         - resource utilization
         - pod resources
         - node resources over time

- Splunk
   - ingest logs from both webapp and k8s cluster
   - create custom dashboard for different components of the webapp
      - user activity
      - error rates
   - configure user roles and permissions, allow new users to search through log with minimum privileges.

## Architecture
### Source Code Management(SCM)
<div align="center">
   <img src="assets/sc.png" alt="Example Image" width="80%" />
</div>

- Source Code Management (SCM): GitHub
- CI/CD Automation Server: Connects to GitHub
- Build Docker Images: CI/CD server pushes images to Dockerhub
- Deployment: Kubernetes cluster pulls images from Dockerhub
- Nodes:
   - Node 1: Contains CI/CD Automation Server and Static Website
   - Node 2: Contains Monitoring and Logging tools
- Monitoring and Logging Tools:
   - Prometheus
   - Grafana
   - Splunk
---
## Features
### Webapp Deployment
- Capable of generating log messages using standard logging patterns and levels.
- A static web application designed to simulate production issues, such as high 5XX and 4XX errors, disruptions in Prometheus exporters, and failures in the Splunk forwarder service or sidecar containers.

### Jenkins (CI/CD Pipeline)
- Automates the build and deployment of the web application whenever changes are made to the source code.

### Splunk
- Capable of ingesting logs from both the web application and the Kubernetes cluster.
- Parses and extracts relevant fields from log entries in a structured manner, facilitating easier log analysis while ensuring sensitive data, such as credentials, is filtered out.
- Dashboard Features:
   - Accurately tracks user activity and error rates.
   - Allows configuration of user roles and permissions, enabling new users to search through logs with restricted privileges.

### Prometheus
- Collects data metrics related to the web application or service, providing insights into performance and resource usage.

### Alerting
- Provides notifications based on key performance indicators (KPIs), such as availability percentage, resource utilization, out-of-memory errors, and error rates.
- Allows the establishment of thresholds and the implementation of annotations for better monitoring.
  
### Grafana
- Provides a dashboard integrated with Prometheus to monitor real-time metrics.
- Accurately counts the number of nodes or pods, categorized by their various statuses.
- Displays charts that visualize container resource utilization, pod resources, and node resources over time.

## User Handbook

### 1. Installing Jenkins in a Kubernetes Cluster
- Create a namespace:
```bash
$ kubectl create namespace jenkins
```
- Create a Service Account:
```bash
$ vi jenkins-serviceaccount.yaml
```
- Copy and paste the following:
```bash
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: jenkins-admin
rules:
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["*"]
    verbs: ["*"]
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: jenkins-admin
  namespace: jenkins
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: jenkins-admin
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: jenkins-admin
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: jenkins-admin
    namespace: jenkins
```
- Then apply the Service Account:
```bash
$ kubectl apply -f jenkins-serviceaccount.yaml
```
- Create PVC for Persistent Jenkins Data:
```bash
$ vi jenkins-volumes.yaml
```
- Copy and paste the following:
```bash
apiVersion: v1 
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim 
metadata: 
  name: jenkins-pvc 
  namespace: jenkins 
spec: 
  storageClassName: linode-block-storage-retain 
  accessModes: 
    - ReadWriteOnce 
  resources: 
    requests: 
      storage: 10Gi 
```
- Then apply the PVC:
```bash
$ kubectl apply -f jenkins-volumes.yaml
```
- Create Deployment:
```bash
$ vi jenkins-deployment.yaml
```
- Copy and paste the following:
```bash
apiVersion: apps/v1
